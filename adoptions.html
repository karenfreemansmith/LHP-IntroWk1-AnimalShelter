    <h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
    <p>For those who already have a home full of pets or are unable to own a pet at this time, there are other ways to help our shelter animals.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Schedule time to help socialize our shelter animals by visiting and playing with our pets. A plus if you have previous experience trianing animals.</li>
      <li>Donate $15 for a pet makeover to help neglected pets find their new family.</li>
    </ul>
